# Responsive Landing Page with Interactive Navigation 🖥️

Welcome to the **Responsive Landing Page** project! This repository showcases a modern, responsive landing page designed with an interactive navigation menu that enhances user experience through dynamic styling and seamless interactivity.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a responsive landing page with a sleek, fixed-position navigation menu. The navigation bar is always visible, providing easy access to all sections of the page. It features dynamic behavior:

- **Color & Style Change on Scroll**: The navigation bar adapts its appearance as users scroll through the page.
- **Hover Effects**: Menu items change color or style when hovered over, offering visual feedback to users.

This project is built using:
- **HTML** for structuring the content
- **CSS** for styling and making the page responsive
- **JavaScript** for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the navigation menu

## 🛠️ Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
- **Interactive Navigation**: A fixed navigation bar that enhances user experience with color and style changes on scroll and hover.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Links smoothly transition users to different sections of the landing page.
